Lesson 1: What is JavaScript

1. Intro to JavaScript
Created by Brandon Eich in 1995.

2. History of JavaScript
Created in 10 days while Eich was working on NetScape Navigator.

Naming: Originally called LiveScript, but changed to JavaScript to piggy back off of the popularity of Java.
Differing versions emerged, and it was eventually turned over to ECMA International for standardization.
The language is still referred to as JavaScript, but versions are referened by their ECMAScript version number (ES5/ES6)
ECMA transitioned to a year-based release cycle, so versions may be labeled by year.

3. The JavaScript Console
Chrome Developer tools shortcuts: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts
Control + Shift + j

JavaScript can be written directly in the console window.
alert("Hello, Julia! How are you")

4. Developer Tools on Different Browsers

- Chrome: Control + Shift + i (Inspect)
- Mozilla Firefox: Control + Shift + i
- Internet Explorer: F12
- Microsoft Edge: F12
- Safari: Command + Option + i
- Opera: Command + Shift + i

5. console.log
console.log can be used to display content to the JavaScript console

console.log("hiya friend!")

Demo example:
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	console.log(i);
}

6. JavaScript Demo
The following code was used to change the heading color:
document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].style.color = "#ff0000";

The following code was used to add an image of a cat to the page using a click listener:
document.body.addEventListener('click', function () {
     var myParent = document.getElementById("Banner"); 
     var myImage = document.createElement("img");
     myImage.src = 'https://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src&type=gif';
     myParent.appendChild(myImage);
     myImage.style.marginLeft = "160px";
});

7. Lesson 1 Summary
All major browsers come with built-in JavaScript engines to run and execute JavaScript code
The JavaScript console allows us to test small snippets and print text
We used JavaScript to add content and update styles on a page
